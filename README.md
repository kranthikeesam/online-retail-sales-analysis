# Online Retail Sales Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes online retail transaction data to understand revenue trends and top-performing countries.  
It demonstrates practical data analyst skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization using Python.

## Dataset
- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository – Online Retail Data Set
- Description: Transactions from a UK-based online retail store between 2010–2011.
- File used: `data/Online_Retail.xlsx`

## Questions Answered
- How does monthly revenue change over time?
- Which countries contribute the most revenue?

## Tech Stack
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, filtering invalid rows)
- Feature engineering (creating TotalPrice and InvoiceMonth)
- Exploratory data analysis (grouping, aggregations, trends)
- Data visualization with matplotlib/seaborn
- Working with Jupyter Notebooks and Git/GitHub for version control




My project aims to analyze online retail sales data to uncover meaningful business insights through data-driven methods. By using Python-based tools such as pandas, matplotlib, and Jupyter Notebook, the analysis focuses on understanding sales trends, customer behavior, and revenue patterns. The goal is to transform raw transaction records into clear visualizations and actionable findings that can support business decision-making. Utilizing data cleaning techniques, feature engineering, and exploratory analysis, this project demonstrates how real-world datasets can be processed to reveal patterns that are not immediately visible. Such analytical approaches play a crucial role in helping businesses optimize performance, target high-value markets, and improve strategic planning.
